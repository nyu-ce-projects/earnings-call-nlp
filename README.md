# earnings-call-nlp

Earnings calls have always been a source of integral information for investors. During these calls, companies discuss financial results, operations, advancements, and hardships that will steer the course and future of the company. In this project, we aim to use the earnings calls data to fine-tune a BERT-based model and draw insights about an organization's performance and score them for sentiment. Additionally, we plan on retrieving other information e.g. projected earnings and revenue stated during the earnings calls.
